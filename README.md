 The first project is "Scientific Calculator". It is a command line python application that can perform 12 mathematical operations.
 Supported operations:
 1- Addition
 2- Subtraction
 3- Multiplication
 4- Division
 5- Modulo
 6- Raise to the power
 7- Square root
 8- Logarithm
 9- Exponential
 10- Sine
 11- Cosine
 12- Tangent
 It also validates the input from the user to ensure its correctness, through recursive calls, in order to avoid errors. Moreover, it can support unfinite number of operations until the user decides to stop.
