 8- Logarithm<br />
 9- Exponential<br />
 10- Sine<br />
 11- Cosine<br />
 12- Tangent<br />
 It also validates the input from the user to ensure its correctness, through recursive calls, in order to avoid errors. Moreover, it can support unfinite number of operations until the user decides to stop.
