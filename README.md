 This repo include python projects done by me
 The first project is "Scientific Calculator". It is a command line python application that can perform 12 mathematical operations.
 Supported operations:<br />
 1- Addition.<br />
 2- Subtraction.<br />
 3- Multiplication.<br />
 4- Division.<br />
 5- Modulo.<br />
 6- Raise to the power.<br />
 7- Square root<br />
 8- Logarithm<br />
 9- Exponential<br />
 10- Sine<br />
 11- Cosine<br />
 12- Tangent<br /><br />
 It also validates the input from the user to ensure its correctness, through recursive calls, in order to avoid errors. Moreover, it can support unfinite number of operations until the user decides to stop.<br />
Project's folder has 2 python files: calculatorBase.py and calculator.py.<br />
Calculator operations methods are implemented in calculatorBase.py. However, to run the applicaiton, user should run calculator.py
